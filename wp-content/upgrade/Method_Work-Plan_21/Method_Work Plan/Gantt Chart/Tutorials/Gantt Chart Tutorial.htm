<h3>The assignment</h3>
<p>Your team is expected to produce a Gantt chart and to keep it up to date for 
  use in planning your project. 

<!-- Use MS Project (available in IT Labs) to produce  -->
<!--   your chart. (Why MS Project? Because it's the most widely used project planning  -->
<!--  package in industry and you should be learning how to use &quot;real world&quot;  -->
<!--  tools.). -->
</p>
<p>Follow these guidelines in creating your chart:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use weeks as the time unit</li>
  <li>Include the Mid-project review, Design Show, and Final report due as milestones. 
    We suggest about 4-10 milestones for your project. </li>
  <li> Show more detail on design tasks, less detail on reports/documentation/presentation 
    tasks. Should have about 3/4 design tasks, 1/4 documentation/presentation 
    related tasks. </li>
  <li>Getting parts can take 2 weeks or more, depending on the part. If your company 
    is building parts for your prototype, getting your part scheduled can take 
    a long time. Build these delays into your planning chart. </li>
  <li>Review and update Gantt chart every 14 days, more often if needed. </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p><h3>Project Planning Basics</h3> 

<p>
A "Project" is a set of activities which ends with specific accomplishment 
and which has (1) Non-routine tasks, (2) Distinct start/finish dates, and (3) 
Resource constraints (time/money/people/equipment). 



</p><p>
"Tasks" are activities which must be completed to acheive project goal. 
Break the project into tasks and subtasks. Tasks have start and end points, are 
short relative to the project and are significant (not "going to library", 
but rather, "search literature"). Use verb-noun form for naming tasks, 
e.g. "create drawings" or "build prototype". Use action verbs 
such as "create", "define" and "gather" rather than 
"will be made". Each task has a duration. Very difficult to estimate 
durations accurately. Doubling your best guess usually works well. 


</p><p>
"Milestones" are important checkpoints or interim goals for a project. 
Can be used to catch scheduling problems early. Name by noun-verb form, e.g. "report 
due", "parts ordered", "prototype complete". 


</p><p>
Your plan will evolve so be flexible and update on a regular basis. It also helps 
to identify risk areas for project, for example, things you don't know how to do 
but will have to learn. These are risky because you may not have a good sense 
for how long the task will take. Or, you may not know how long it will take to 
receive components you purchased for a project. 

</p><h3> Work Breakdown Structure</h3>

<p>
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a categorized list of tasks with an estimate 
of resources required to complete the task. An example WBS appears below.

</p><h3>Gantt Chart Basics</h3> 

<p>
Gantt charts are a project planning tool that can be used to represent the timing 
of tasks required to complete a project. Because Gantt charts are simple to understand 
and easy to construct, they are used by most project managers for all but the 
most complex projects. 

</p><p>
In a Gantt chart, each task takes up one row. Dates run along the top in increments 
of days, weeks or months, depending on the total length of the project. The expected 
time for each task is represented by a horizontal bar whose left end marks the 
expected beginning of the task and whose right end marks the expected completion 
date. Tasks may run sequentially, in parallel or overlapping. 



</p><p>
As the project progresses, the chart is updated by filling in the bars to a length 
proportional to the fraction of work that has been accomplished on the task. This 
way, one can get a quick reading of project progress by drawing a vertical line 
through the chart at the current date. Completed tasks lie to the left of the 
line and are completely filled in. Current tasks cross the line and are behind 
schedule if their filled-in section is to the left of the line and ahead of schedule 
if the filled-in section stops to the right of the line. Future tasks lie completely 
to the right of the line. 

</p><p>
In constructing a Gantt chart, keep the tasks to a manageable number (no more 
than 15 or 20) so that the chart fits on a single page. More complex projects 
may require subordinate charts which detail the timing of all the subtasks which 
make up one of the main tasks. For team projects, it often helps to have an additional 
column containing numbers or initials which identify who on the team is responsible 
for the task. 

</p><p>
Often the project has important events which you would like to appear on the project 
timeline, but which are not tasks. For example, you may wish to highlight when 
a prototype is complete or the date of a design review. You enter these on a Gantt 
chart as "milestone" events and mark them with a special symbol, often 
an upside-down triangle.


</p><h3>Using Excel to Make Gantt Charts</h3> 

A <a href="http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me4054/assignments/gantt.pdf">sample Gantt chart</a> (.pdf format) made using Microsoft 
Excel appears in the figure which accompanies this document. If today's date were 
May 13, Task A would be behind schedule, Task B ahead and Task C right on schedule. 
The events marked by fat dots are milestones. 
<p>
Gantt charts made with  Excel are easy to update and maintain. Here's how to do it. 

</p><p>
Select tasks from your work breakdown structure.
Your WBS also indicates the person-hours of effort and people
responsible for the tasks.
Assign each task tentative start and stop dates (or durations) based on 
the information in the WBS. Also 
list important milestones and their dates. If you have more than 15 or 20 tasks, 
split your project into main tasks and subtasks, then make an overall Gantt chart 
for the main tasks and separate Gantt charts for the subtasks which make up each 
main task. 


</p><p>
Decide what resolution to use in the timeline. For projects of three months or 
less, use days, for longer projects use weeks or months, and for very short project 
use hours. For these instructions, we will assume you have chosen a resolution 
of days. 


</p><p>
Fire up Excel. Under Page Setup, select landscape orientation, and then select 
the options to center the chart horizontally and vertically on the page. Also 
under Page Setup, activate the "fit to one page" button. (Note that 
if the text comes out too small, you may have to print your chart on two pages 
and paste together. Even better, adjust the resolution of your date scale or drop 
less important tasks to make your chart fit comfortably on one page.) Still under 
Page Setup, set header and footer to be blank. (It's better to write the title 
right on the spreadsheet rather than use the header for the title. Finally, under 
Page Setup, turn off the option to print gridlines. 



</p><p>
Set up the cells. You can use the sample (found elsewhere on this web page) as 
a guide. Use the border command to draw boxes around the appropriate cells. Enter 
your scheduling data. To make the gray bars which indicate length of task, select 
the appropriate cells, then the fill command (one of the buttons near the top). 

</p><p>
As the project progresses, fill in the gray bars with black to denote the fraction 
of a task that is complete. 

</p><h3>Project Management Packages</h3>

<p>
</p>

<p>
You can also create Gantt charts using a project managment computer package. A 
sample chart made using Microsoft Project appears below. Project is the most widely 
used scheduling tool for small projects. It is available on the PC's in MechE 
308 for use by IT students.


</p><p>

</p><p>We strongly recommend that you use MS Project to create your Gantt 
charts, if nothing else because it will give you experience using this 
important package. 

</p><p>To embedd a Project Gantt chart into a Word document, get the chart 
showing on the screen, then Edit &gt; Copy Picture... &gt; to GIF file. From 
there you can import the gif file into Word. You may have to rotate it 90 
degrees in MS Paint to get it to fit and be readable.
